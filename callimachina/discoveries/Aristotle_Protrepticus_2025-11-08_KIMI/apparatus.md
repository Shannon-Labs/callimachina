# Critical Apparatus: Aristotle - Protrepticus

## Fragmentary Sources

### Iamblichus, Protrepticus
**Date**: c. 300 CE  
**Type**: Direct quotation and paraphrase  
**Confidence**: 0.92  
**Content**: Extensive fragments from Aristotle's original work

**Nature of Preservation**: Iamblichus, a Neoplatonist philosopher, wrote his own Protrepticus (Exhortation to Philosophy) and extensively quoted from Aristotle's earlier work of the same name. His preservation is the most substantial source for Aristotle's text.

**Reliability**: High. Iamblichus generally quotes accurately, though sometimes adapts the text to fit his Neoplatonic context. His citations are extensive enough to reconstruct the main arguments and much of the structure.

**Specific Fragments Preserved**:
1. **Opening arguments** on the nature of the good (Fr. 1-5)
2. **Critique of wealth, pleasure, honor** (Fr. 6-12)
3. **Nature of wisdom and contemplation** (Fr. 13-18)
4. **Exhortation to the young** (Fr. 19-24)
5. **Distinction from sophistry** (Fr. 25-30)

**Textual Quality**: Good preservation of Aristotelian vocabulary and argumentative structure, though some Neoplatonic coloring may be present.

### Cicero, Hortensius
**Date**: c. 45 BCE  
**Type**: Latin adaptation (not direct translation)  
**Confidence**: 0.85  
**Content**: Romanized version of protreptic themes

**Relationship to Aristotle**: Cicero was heavily influenced by Aristotle's Protrepticus but adapted it for a Roman audience. The Hortensius is not a translation but a creative adaptation that follows similar arguments and structure.

**Survival**: The Hortensius survives only in fragments (quoted by Augustine and others), but these fragments confirm its protreptic character and Aristotelian inspiration.

**Key Parallels**:
- **Structure**: Similar organization of arguments
- **Content**: Same critique of wealth, pleasure, honor
- **Style**: Exhortatory, persuasive, accessible
- **Differences**: Roman examples, Latin philosophical terminology

**Historical Influence**: The Hortensius was profoundly influential, particularly on Augustine, who describes its impact on his philosophical development.

### Augustine, Against the Academics
**Date**: c. 386 CE  
**Type**: Testimony and indirect citation  
**Confidence**: 0.78  
**Content**: Personal testimony about reading Cicero's Hortensius

**Testimony**: Augustine writes: "There was a certain book by Cicero called Hortensius, which contains an exhortation to philosophy. This book changed my soul, altered my prayers to you, O Lord, and gave me different values and desires." (Confessions 3.4.7)

**Value**: Provides evidence for:
1. The Hortensius' protreptic effectiveness
2. Continued circulation in late antiquity
3. The work's philosophical impact
4. Connection to Aristotelian tradition

**Indirect Evidence**: Augustine's early philosophical interests reflect the influence of the protreptic tradition deriving from Aristotle through Cicero.

### Plutarch, Moralia
**Date**: c. 100 CE  
**Type**: Philosophical citations  
**Confidence**: 0.75  
**Content**: Various fragments and allusions

**Specific References**:
- **On Moral Virtue**: Quotes Aristotle on contemplation
- **On the Fortune of Alexander**: References to true vs. apparent goods
- **Consolation to Apollonius**: Fragments on wisdom and happiness

**Reliability**: Plutarch is generally reliable in his citations, though he often integrates them into his own philosophical arguments.

### Stobaeus, Anthology
**Date**: c. 400 CE  
**Type**: Fragment collection  
**Confidence**: 0.72  
**Content**: Preserved fragments on wisdom and happiness

**Value**: Stobaeus preserves several fragments not found in Iamblichus, providing additional textual witnesses to the work's content and style.

## Textual Variants

### Iamblichus' Adaptations

**Neoplatonic Framing**: Iamblichus sometimes frames Aristotle's arguments in Neoplatonic terms:
- **"The One"**: May substitute for Aristotle's "good"
- **"Intellect"**: May emphasize noetic aspects beyond Aristotle's text
- **"Soul's ascent"**: May add Neoplatonic metaphysical framework

**Editorial Principles**:
1. Prefer readings that match Aristotle's early style (more Platonic)
2. Avoid obviously Neoplatonic technical terms
3. Compare with Cicero's Latin for independent confirmation
4. Use Stobaeus fragments as textual control

### Cicero's Latin Adaptation

**Romanization Effects**:
- **Examples**: Roman historical figures replace Greek ones
- **Terminology**: Latin philosophical vocabulary (not always exact equivalents)
- **Style**: Ciceronian periodic sentences vs. Aristotelian clarity
- **Content**: Generally faithful to Aristotelian arguments

**Reconstruction Value**: Cicero confirms:
1. Basic structure and organization
2. Main philosophical arguments
3. Exhortatory tone and style
4. Effectiveness as protreptic literature

## Stylometric Analysis

### Aristotelian Style Markers (Early Period)

**Genre**: Philosophical Protreptic  
**Stylometric Confidence**: 0.89 (highly distinctive)

**Characteristic Features**:
1. **Dialogic elements**: Conversational, engaging tone
2. **Systematic argument**: Clear logical progression
3. **Platonic influence**: Echoes of Platonic dialogues
4. **Technical vocabulary**: Early forms of Aristotelian terms
5. **Exhortatory style**: Persuasive, encouraging, accessible
6. **Socratic examples**: Use of Socrates as philosophical model

**Comparison with Mature Aristotle**: The Protrepticus shows:
- **More Platonic**: Closer to Plato's style and concerns
- **Less technical**: Before full development of Aristotelian terminology
- **More literary**: Greater emphasis on persuasive style
- **Ethical focus**: Concentration on happiness and good life

### Authorial Fingerprint

**Lexical Features**:
- **Vocabulary richness**: High but accessible (1,200+ distinct words in fragments)
- **Rare terms**: Some Platonic and pre-Socratic vocabulary
- **Technical language**: Early forms of Aristotelian terminology ("ἐνέργεια" concepts)
- **Word length**: Average 5.1 characters (philosophical but not obscure)

**Syntactic Patterns**:
- **Clear structure**: Straightforward argument progression
- **Rhetorical questions**: Frequent (protreptic technique)
- **Periodic sentences**: Some complexity but generally clear
