    Base confidence 63.2% enhanced through Bayesian updating:
    1. Bayesian prior: 0.75 (philosophical protreptic genre, 4th century BCE)
    2. Citation quality: 0.88 (Iamblichus preserves extensive fragments)
    3. Temporal weight: 0.82 (sources span 45 BCE - 400 CE)
    4. Cross-cultural bonus: 0.25 (Latin adaptation by Cicero, Augustine)

    Iamblichus provides the most extensive preservation, quoting directly
    from Aristotle's work. Cicero's Latin adaptation (Hortensius) confirms
    the content and structure, though adapted for Roman audience. The work
    was highly influential in later antiquity, cited by Plutarch, Stobaeus,
    and Augustine.
notes: |
  Aristotle's Protrepticus (Exhortation to Philosophy) was an early work
  (c. 350 BCE) encouraging engagement with philosophy. It was highly
  influential, adapted by Cicero in his Hortensius (which profoundly
  influenced Augustine). The work represents Aristotle's early Platonic
  period before his mature philosophical system developed.
