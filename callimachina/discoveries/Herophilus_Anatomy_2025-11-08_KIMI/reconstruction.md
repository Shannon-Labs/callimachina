## Book 1: The Brain and Nervous System

### The Brain as Control Center

[…] The brain is the governing organ of the body [Galen, On Anatomical Procedures]. All nerves originate from the brain, and through them the brain controls all voluntary motion [?].

### The Ventricles

The brain contains four ventricles […] Two lateral ventricles in the cerebrum, and two smaller ventricles in the cerebellum [Galen]. These contain psychic pneuma, which the brain distributes through the nerves [?].

### Nerves vs. Tendons

[…] We have discovered that nerves are distinct from tendons [Rufus]. Nerves are soft and convey sensation and motion, while tendons are hard and serve to connect muscles to bones [Galen].

## Book 2: The Eye and Vision

### The Structure of the Eye

The eye consists of several layers […] The outermost is the cornea, then the aqueous humor, then the crystalline lens, and finally the retina [Galen].

### The Optic Nerve

[…] Vision occurs through the optic nerve, which carries visual impressions from the eye to the brain [Galen]. This nerve is hollow, allowing the passage of psychic pneuma [?].

### The Mechanism of Vision

Images enter through the pupil and are focused by the lens onto the retina […] From there, the optic nerve transmits the image to the brain, where it is perceived [Celsus].

## Book 3: The Reproductive System

### The Ovaries

[…] We have discovered that women have ovaries, just as men have testes [Galen]. These contain the female seed, which contributes to generation [?].

### The Uterus

The uterus has three layers […] The outer membrane, the muscular middle layer, and the inner membrane [Rufus]. Each serves a different function in pregnancy [?].

### The Process of Conception

Conception occurs when male and female seeds mix in the uterus […] The mixture must be in proper proportion for successful generation [Galen].

## Book 4: The Pulse and Circulation

### The Pulse as Diagnostic Tool

[…] The pulse reveals the condition of the arteries and the heart [Galen]. By feeling the pulse, we can diagnose many diseases [?].

### Types of Pulse

There are many types of pulse […] Some are fast, some slow, some strong, some weak [Rufus]. Each type indicates a different condition of the body [Galen].

### The Pulse and the Heart

The pulse originates in the heart […] With each beat, the heart sends pneuma through the arteries, causing them to expand [Galen]. This expansion is what we feel as the pulse [?].

## Critical Apparatus Notes

**Galen's Citations**: Galen (c. 180 CE) frequently cites Herophilus as an authority on anatomy, preserving many detailed observations about the brain, nerves, and reproductive system.

**Revolutionary Discoveries**: Herophilus made several revolutionary discoveries through systematic dissection:
- Brain as control center (not just cooling organ)
- Distinction between nerves and tendons
- Ventricles of the brain
- Ovaries in female reproductive system

**Methodological Innovation**: Herophilus was the first to systematically dissect human cadavers in Alexandria, establishing anatomy as a scientific discipline.

**Transmission**: His work influenced all subsequent ancient medicine, particularly through Galen, who frequently cites him as an authority.

**Pneumatic Theory**: Herophilus worked within the pneumatic theory of medicine, explaining function through the movement of pneuma (vital spirit) through the body.
