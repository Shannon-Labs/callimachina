    Herophilus was the first to systematically dissect human bodies,
    making revolutionary discoveries. Multiple medical writers (Galen,
    Rufus, Celsus) cite his anatomical observations. The work was
    foundational for understanding the nervous system, brain, and
    reproductive anatomy.
notes: |
  Herophilus (c. 330-260 BCE) was the "father of anatomy" who first
  systematically dissected human cadavers in Alexandria. His discoveries
  included the distinction between nerves and tendons, the ventricles of
  the brain, and the ovaries. His work revolutionized medical understanding
  and established anatomy as a scientific discipline.
