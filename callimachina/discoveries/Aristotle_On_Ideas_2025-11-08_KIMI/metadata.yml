    Multiple ancient commentaries (Alexander, Syrianus, Asclepius) preserve
    substantial fragments. These represent different philosophical schools
    (Peripatetic, Neoplatonic) providing independent confirmation. The work
    is crucial for understanding Aristotle's critique of Platonic Forms.
notes: |
  Aristotle's On Ideas was a systematic critique of Plato's Theory of Forms.
  It represents his mature metaphysical thought and is frequently referenced
  in his other works. The ancient commentaries preserve important fragments
  that illuminate Aristotle's arguments against separate, transcendent Forms.
