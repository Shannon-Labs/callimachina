## Introduction: The Problem of Universals

### Statement of Purpose

[…] We must examine the doctrine which asserts that Ideas exist separately from sensible things [Alexander, Commentary on Metaphysics]. For this is the central question in Plato's philosophy, and it concerns the very nature of being [?].

### The Arguments for Ideas

Plato and his followers established Ideas through several arguments […] The most important is the argument from common predicates: when we say that many things are 'good' or 'just,' there must be some one Idea in which they all participate [Alexander].

## Book 1: Critique of the Argument from Common Predication

### The Problem of Participation

[…] If sensible things participate in Ideas, they must do so either wholly or partially [Alexander]. But if wholly, then the Idea would be in many places at once, which is impossible [?]. If partially, then the Idea would be divided, which contradicts its unity [Alexander].

### The Third Man Argument

Furthermore, if we predicate 'man' of many individuals because they participate in the Idea of Man, then we must also posit a third 'man' in which both the individuals and the Idea participate [Alexander]. This leads to an infinite regress, which is absurd [?].

### The Argument from Relatives

[…] The argument from relatives fails because relations exist only between terms, not as separate Ideas [Syrianus]. If there is an Idea of 'greater,' it must be greater than something, but what can the Idea be greater than [?]?

## Book 2: The Argument from Sciences

### The Problem of Separate Objects

They argue that the sciences must have objects that are separate from sensible things, for sciences are of universals, not particulars [Alexander]. But this confuses the mode of knowing with the mode of being [?].

### The Unity of Definition

[…] If the sciences define their objects, and definitions are of universals, then there must be universal Ideas corresponding to these definitions [Asclepius]. However, definition is a logical operation, not a metaphysical one [?].

### The Argument from the One Over Many

The argument that there must be one over many is flawed because it confuses logical universals with metaphysical substances [Simplicius]. The universal 'man' is not a separate thing, but a way of referring to many particular men [?].

---

## Book 3: The Nature of Mathematical Objects

### Mathematical Intermediates

[…] Plato posited mathematical objects as intermediates between Ideas and sensible things [Alexander]. But this creates a third realm where only two are necessary [?]. Mathematical objects can be understood as abstractions from sensible things, not separate substances [?].

### The Ontological Status of Numbers

Numbers are not separate Ideas, for they are predicated of things that are numbered [Syrianus]. The number 'two' is not a separate thing, but a property of pairs of things [?].

---

## Book 4: Alternative Accounts of Universals

### Universals in the Mind

[…] We must say that universals exist in the mind, not as separate substances [Alexander]. They are concepts abstracted from particulars by the intellect [?].

### The Role of Experience

Universals are formed through experience and memory [Asclepius]. When we perceive many particular men, we form the concept 'man' by abstraction [?].

### The Status of Essences

Essences are not separate Ideas, but are what is expressed in definitions [Simplicius]. The essence of man is not a separate thing, but what it is to be a man [?].

## Critical Apparatus Notes

**Ancient Commentaries**: The work is preserved primarily through ancient commentaries on Aristotle's Metaphysics, particularly:
- **Alexander of Aphrodisias** (c. 200 CE): Peripatetic commentary, most reliable
- **Syrianus** (c. 430 CE): Neoplatonic commentary, preserves important fragments
- **Asclepius** (c. 550 CE): Byzantine commentary, scholastic tradition
- **Simplicius** (c. 540 CE): Cross-references in Physics commentary

**Argument Structure**: The work systematically examines and refutes the main arguments for Platonic Ideas:
1. From common predication (Third Man)
2. From sciences (objects of knowledge)
3. From relatives (relations)
4. From mathematical objects

**Philosophical Significance**: This work represents Aristotle's mature critique of Plato's Theory of Forms, establishing his own metaphysical alternative. It influenced later Neoplatonic and scholastic debates about universals.

**Transmission**: The work was influential in antiquity but survives only in fragments. The ancient commentaries preserve substantial portions, allowing reconstruction of Aristotle's main arguments.
