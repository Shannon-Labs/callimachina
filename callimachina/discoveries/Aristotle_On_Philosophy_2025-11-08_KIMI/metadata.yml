    Cicero's Latin adaptation preserves the dialogue structure and main
    arguments. Philo and Clement provide additional witnesses from different
    cultural contexts (Jewish, Christian). The work was influential in
    Hellenistic and Roman philosophy.
notes: |
  Aristotle's On Philosophy was a dialogue (unlike his treatises) discussing
  the nature and value of philosophy. It was influential in antiquity and
  adapted by Cicero. The work represents Aristotle's more literary approach
  before his mature technical philosophy.
