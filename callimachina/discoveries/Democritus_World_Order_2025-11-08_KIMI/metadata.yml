    Democritus' World Order survives through extensive ancient philosophical
    discussion, particularly in Aristotle's physical treatises and later
    doxographical sources. The work's systematic presentation of atomic
    cosmology generated significant ancient commentary. Multiple sources
    preserve the distinctive arguments for atomism and the infinite universe.
notes: |
  Democritus' World Order was a systematic cosmological treatise presenting
  atomic theory as the foundation for understanding the universe. The work
  developed Leucippus' atomic hypothesis into a comprehensive natural
  philosophy, explaining cosmic order through the mechanical interaction of
  atoms in the void. Its influence on ancient philosophy was profound,
  particularly through Aristotle's critical engagement and Epicurean
  adaptation, ensuring preservation through extensive doxographical tradition.
