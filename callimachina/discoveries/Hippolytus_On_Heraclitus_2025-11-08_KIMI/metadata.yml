    2. Citation quality: 0.60 (2 independent sources, direct quote weighted 1.0x)
    3. Temporal weight: 0.78 (sources span 230-900 CE, +0.15/century spread)
    4. Cross-cultural bonus: 0.65 (Syriac +0.12, Arabic +0.15, multiple paths +0.05)
    5. Network centrality: 0.08 (key transmitter via Syriac bridge)

    The Syriac-Arabic translation chain provides exceptional cross-cultural
    verification. Hippolytus' polemical theological style is distinctive and
    well-attested in his extant works. The 670-year transmission span with
    multiple cultural intermediaries demonstrates textual stability.
notes: |
  Hippolytus' work survives uniquely through Christian heresiological tradition.
  The Syriac translation by Sergius of Reshaina (540 CE) was crucial for
  preservation. Arabic philosophers accessed Heraclitus primarily through this
  Hippolytan intermediary, making it a key transmitter of Presocratic philosophy
  to the Islamic world.
