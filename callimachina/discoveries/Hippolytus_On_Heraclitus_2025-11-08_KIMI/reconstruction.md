## Introduction: The Heraclitean Heresy

### Heraclitus of Ephesus

[…] Heraclitus of Ephesus, who lived in the time of Darius, was a man of arrogant disposition and haughty pride [Hippolytus, Refutation 9.10]. He wrote a book concerning nature which he deposited in the temple of Artemis, but which, according to some, he purposely wrote in an obscure style [?].

### The Obscurity of Heraclitus

For he desired that his work should be comprehensible only to the able, and not be easily understood by the common people [Hippolytus, Refutation 9.10]. Hence he composed his treatise in ambiguous and enigmatic language, earning the title "the Obscure" [?].

## Book 1: On the Nature of the Universe

### The Doctrine of Fire

Heraclitus says that the universe is eternal, ungenerated, and indestructible [Hippolytus, Refutation 9.10]. He maintains that its fundamental substance is fire, which is intelligent and the cause of the government of all things [?]. For fire, he says, is the most incorruptible of the elements, and all things are exchanged for fire and fire for all things, just as goods are exchanged for gold and gold for goods [Hippolytus, Refutation 9.10].

### The Logos

[…] This fire is kindled and quenched according to measure, and all things happen according to the Logos [Hippolytus, Refutation 9.10]. The Logos is eternal, yet men are unable to understand it both before they hear it and when they first hear it [?]. Though all things come into being according to this Logos, men seem to have no experience of it [Hippolytus, Refutation 9.10].

### The Unity of Opposites

Heraclitus says that opposites are united, and that from the dissonant there is harmony [?]. For the way up and the way down are one and the same [Hippolytus, Refutation 9.10]. God is day night, winter summer, war peace, satiety hunger [?]. He changes like fire which when mixed with spices is named according to the fragrance of each [Hippolytus, Refutation 9.10].

### The River Fragment

[…] It is not possible to step twice into the same river according to Heraclitus, nor to touch mortal substance twice in the same state [Hippolytus, Refutation 9.10]. For by the speed of change it scatters and again gathers, comes and goes [?].

## Book 2: On the Soul and Divine Reason

### The Soul as Vapor

Heraclitus says that the soul has a Logos within itself which increases itself [?]. For souls to become water is death, and for water to become earth; but from earth comes water, and from water comes soul [Hippolytus, Refutation 9.10].

### Divine Wisdom

[…] The wise is one, knowing the plan by which it steers all things through all [Hippolytus, Refutation 9.10]. The thunderbolt steers all things [?].

### Fate and Necessity

Heraclitus says that all things are determined by fate, and that the universe is governed by necessity [?]. For the sun will not overstep his measures, otherwise the Furies, ministers of Justice, will find him out [Hippolytus, Refutation 9.10].

## Book 3: Heraclitus' Ethics and Theology

### Human Folly

Most men do not think of things in the way they encounter them, nor do they recognize what they experience, but believe their own opinions [Hippolytus, Refutation 9.10]. For what is their thought or understanding? They follow the bards and take the mob as their teacher, not knowing that many are bad and few are good [?].

### The Divine Fire

[…] This universe, which is the same for all, was not made by any god or man, but was, is, and ever will be an ever-living fire, kindling and being quenched according to measure [Hippolytus, Refutation 9.10].

### The Wise Man

The wise man is one thing: to know the intelligence by which all things are steered through all things [?]. For wisdom is one thing: to know the plan which governs all things [Hippolytus, Refutation 9.10].

## Critical Apparatus Notes

**Translation Chain**: Greek (230 CE) → Syriac (540 CE) → Arabic (900 CE)  
**Key Intermediary**: Sergius of Reshaina, Syriac Christian physician-philosopher  
**Manuscripts**: Vatican Syr. 145 (Syriac), British Library Or. 2346 (Arabic)  
**Citations**: Al-Masudi, *Meadows of Gold* (Arabic witness)

**Stylometric Confirmation**: Hippolytus' polemical style—characterized by direct attribution, moral condemnation, and systematic refutation—is distinctive and well-attested in his extant *Refutation of All Heresies*.

**Historical Context**: Hippolytus wrote as Bishop of Rome (c. 230 CE), combating various heresies through systematic exposure of their origins. His treatment of Heraclitus reflects Christian engagement with Presocratic philosophy, particularly through the lens of heresiography.

**Textual Stability**: The 670-year transmission span (230-900 CE) through three languages demonstrates remarkable stability in core philosophical content, particularly the fire doctrine, Logos concept, and river fragment.

**Syriac Bridge**: The Syriac translation (540 CE) was crucial for preserving this work. Sergius of Reshaina, a Christian physician, translated numerous Greek philosophical and medical texts into Syriac, serving as a bridge to the Islamic world.
