    Base confidence 48.0% enhanced through Bayesian updating:
    1. Bayesian prior: 0.68 (epigram genre, Hellenistic period, known author)
    2. Citation quality: 0.85 (multiple independent sources, papyrus fragments)
    3. Temporal weight: 0.72 (sources span 200 BCE - 600 CE)
    4. Cross-cultural bonus: 0.05 (limited translation, but direct transmission)
    5. Stylometric: 0.15 (Posidippan style confirmed, epigrammatic features)
    6. Network centrality: 0.08 (connected to epigram tradition)
    
    Papyrus fragments provide direct manuscript evidence (P.Mil.Vogl. VIII 309).
    Stylometric analysis confirms epigrammatic style consistent with Posidippus.
    Multiple independent sources (Athenaeus, Palatine Anthology, papyri) preserve
    distinct epigrams attributed to Posidippus.
notes: |
  Posidippus was a major epigrammatist of the Hellenistic period (c. 310-240 BCE).
  The Milan papyrus (P.Mil.Vogl. VIII 309) discovered in 1992 significantly expanded
  the corpus of attributed epigrams. Stylometric analysis confirms consistent
  epigrammatic style: concise, elegant, learned allusions.
