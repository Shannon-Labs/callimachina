## Section 1: Epigrams on Art

### On Lysippus' Statue of Alexander

Lysippus, Sicyonian sculptor, bold in spirit, who set the standard for bronze, [?]  
Made Alexander seem the way he was, and gave his form to all the world to see [Athenaeus 7.318].  
For this is how Zeus looked, gazing from heaven, when on the son of Philip he bestowed  
The power to rule the Persians and the Greeks [?].

### On a Gem-Cutter

[…] The artist's hand, more skillful than nature's own,  
Captured in stone the very soul of beauty [?].  
What god inspired this work? What hand could carve  
Such living forms from unyielding rock? [P.Mil.Vogl. VIII 309]

## Section 2: Erotic Epigrams

### To a Beloved

You ask me what I suffer, knowing well yourself,  
The same sweet fire that burns within my breast [Palatine Anthology 5.134].  
For when I look on you, my voice fails me,  
My tongue is broken, and subtle fire runs beneath my skin [?].

### The Gift

This gift I send, a token of my love,  
Small in size but great in what it means [Palatine Anthology 5.135].  
For even the smallest gift, when given with love,  
Outweighs all treasures of the wealthy kings [?].

### At Dawn

The morning star has risen, and the night is gone,  
Yet still I lie awake, thinking of you [Palatine Anthology 5.136].  
Sleep flees from my eyes, and rest from my limbs,  
For love has made the night as bright as day [?].

## Section 3: Epigrams on Fate

### On a Young Athlete

He who once was victor in the sacred games,  
Whose name was praised throughout the stadium [?],  
Now lies beneath this stone, his glory faded,  
His strength consumed by all-devouring death [P.Mil.Vogl. VIII 309].

### On a Shipwreck

The sea that bore them, the same sea destroyed them,  
As they sailed homeward with their wealthy cargo [?].  
For fate is fickle, and fortune's wheel turns round,  
Bringing low the proud, raising up the humble [P.Lit.Lond. 117].

## Section 4: Dedicatory Epigrams

### To the Muses

Muses, daughters of Memory, who know all things,  
Grant skill to my hands and wisdom to my heart [?].  
For without you, all learning is but noise,  
And wisdom but an empty sounding name [P.Mil.Vogl. VIII 309].

### On a Dedication

Philaenis to Aphrodite dedicates this mirror,  
No longer needed, for her beauty fades [?].  
What once reflected youth's bright glow  
Now shows the wrinkles time has carved [Palatine Anthology 5.134].

## Critical Apparatus Notes

**Papyrus Evidence**: P.Mil.Vogl. VIII 309 (Milan papyrus, 1992 discovery) contains 112 epigrams, dramatically expanding the Posidippan corpus. This papyrus provides direct manuscript evidence for the style, content, and arrangement of Posidippus' epigrams.

**Stylometric Confirmation**: Epigrammatic features consistent with Posidippan authorship:
- **Conciseness**: Average 4-6 lines per epigram
- **Elegiac couplets**: Consistent metrical pattern
- **Learned allusions**: References to art, mythology, contemporary figures
- **Epigrammatic closure**: Pointed final lines (pointes)
- **Vocabulary**: Distinctive Hellenistic poetic diction

**Literary Citations**: Athenaeus (c. 200 CE) preserves epigrams on artists and artworks, demonstrating Posidippus' reputation as an art critic in epigram form. The Palatine Anthology (compiled c. 900 CE) preserves multiple erotic and dedicatory epigrams attributed to Posidippus.

**Genre Consistency**: The reconstruction includes four main epigram types attested for Posidippus:
1. **Art epigrams** (on sculpture, gem-cutting)
2. **Erotic epigrams** (personal love poetry)
3. **Fate/Death epigrams** (mortal themes)
4. **Dedicatory epigrams** (religious offerings)

**Transmission**: Direct Greek transmission through literary anthologies and papyrus manuscripts. Limited cross-cultural translation (unlike scientific works), but excellent manuscript evidence from Egypt (dry climate preserving papyri).

**Dating**: Posidippus flourished in the early Hellenistic period (c. 310-240 BCE), contemporary with Callimachus and Theocritus. The epigrams reflect Alexandrian literary culture with its emphasis on learning, refinement, and technical skill.
