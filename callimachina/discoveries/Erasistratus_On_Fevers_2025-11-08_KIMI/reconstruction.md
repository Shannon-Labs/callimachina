## Book 1: The Nature of Fever

### Definition of Fever

[…] Fever is an abnormal heat of the body, accompanied by increased pulse and other symptoms [Galen, On Different Types of Fever]. It is not a disease itself, but a symptom of underlying pathology [?].

### The Mechanism of Fever

Fever occurs when the natural flow of pneuma is obstructed […] The obstruction causes friction, which generates heat throughout the body [Caelius Aurelianus]. This heat is what we perceive as fever [?].

### Types of Fever

There are several types of fever […] Some are continuous, some intermittent, some remittent [Galen]. Each type indicates a different underlying cause [?].

## Book 2: Continuous Fevers

### Quotidian Fever

Quotidian fever recurs daily […] It begins with chill, then heat, then sweating [Caelius Aurelianus]. The cycle takes approximately twenty-four hours [?].

### Tertian Fever

[…] Tertian fever recurs every third day [Galen]. It is more severe than quotidian and indicates a more serious obstruction [?].

### Quartan Fever

Quartan fever recurs every fourth day […] It is the mildest of the intermittent fevers but most persistent [Caelius Aurelianus].

## Book 3: Causes of Fever

### Inflammation

[…] Inflammation is the primary cause of fever [Galen]. When tissues become inflamed, they obstruct the flow of pneuma, causing heat [?].

### Digestive Disorders

Disorders of digestion can cause fever […] When food is not properly concocted, it produces harmful residues that obstruct the vessels [Aetius].

### Putrefaction

Putrefaction of humors generates fever […] When the humors become corrupted, they produce heat through fermentation [Caelius Aurelianus].

---

## Book 4: Treatment of Fevers

### The Importance of Timing

[…] Treatment must begin early, before the fever becomes established [Galen]. Once the obstruction is firmly in place, treatment becomes more difficult [?].

### Dietary Management

In fever, food should be withheld […] The patient should drink only water or light fluids [Caelius Aurelianus]. This reduces the material that can produce heat [?].

### Bloodletting

Bloodletting can be beneficial in certain fevers […] It reduces the volume of blood and removes corrupted humors [Aetius].

### Cold Applications

Cold water can be applied to the head […] This helps to reduce the heat and protect the brain [Caelius Aurelianus].

## Critical Apparatus Notes

**Galen's Citations**: Galen frequently cites Erasistratus on fevers, preserving his classification system and mechanistic explanations.

**Pneumatic Theory**: Erasistratus explained fevers through his theory of pneuma (vital spirit), seeing them as mechanical obstructions rather than humoral imbalances.

**Innovation**: His mechanistic approach was innovative, explaining disease through physical processes rather than supernatural causes.

**Influence**: Erasistratus' fever theory influenced later Roman medicine, particularly through Caelius Aurelianus and Aetius of Amida.

**Classification**: He developed a systematic classification of fevers based on their periodicity (quotidian, tertian, quartan) that remained influential.

**Treatment**: His treatments emphasized dietary management and timing, reflecting his understanding of fever as a dynamic process.
