    Erasistratus developed pneumatic physiology and fever theory. His
    mechanistic approach to disease influenced Hellenistic and Roman
    medicine. Multiple medical writers preserve his observations on
    fever types and treatments. The work was innovative in explaining
    disease through natural causes.
notes: |
  Erasistratus (c. 315-240 BCE) developed a sophisticated theory of
  disease based on pneuma (vital spirit) and mechanical processes.
  He explained fevers as resulting from inflammation and friction
  of moving particles. His work influenced Galen and represented
  an important development in rational medicine.
