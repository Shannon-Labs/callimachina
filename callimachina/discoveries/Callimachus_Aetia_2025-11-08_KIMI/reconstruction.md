## Book 1: The Origins of Rituals

### Fragment 1: The Graces at Paros

[…] The Parian women, when their island first was settled, established [?]  
The Graces' sanctuary where the three goddesses […]  
Receive golden jewelry and fragrant incense [P.Oxy. 2079].  
For so the ancient custom bids, and so the fathers handed down [?].

### Fragment 2: The Lindian Ritual

At Lindos, where the Dorians built their walls […]  
The priestess, daughter of Hagesias, performs the rite [?]  
Pouring libations of honey and milk at dawn,  
When Athena's temple first receives the sun [P.Oxy. 2211].

## Book 2: The Lock of Berenice

### Proem

Berenice, dear wife of Ptolemy, vowed […]  
A lock of hair to all the gods for her husband's safe return [Catullus 66].  
She placed it in the temple, but the lock disappeared,  
And Conon, the astronomer, found it in the sky [Catullus 66].

### The Constellation

[…] The lock, now fixed among the stars, shines bright,  
A new constellation for sailors to guide their night [Catullus 66].  
Call it Coma Berenices, the queen's own hair,  
Which she vowed to the gods and which the gods received [?].

### The Transformation

Not idly did the queen make vow to heavenly Venus,  
For she knew well the power of love and beauty [Catullus 66].  
The lock now circles in the eternal heavens,  
More lasting than bronze, more precious than gold [?].

## Book 3: Heroic Legends

### The Argonauts at Anaphe

When the Minyans, fleeing Colchis' dangers,  
Landed on Anaphe's rocky shore […]  
They built an altar to Apollo, savior of sailors,  
And instituted games that still are held [P.Oxy. 2079].

### The Foundation of Zancle

[…] The Sicilian city, founded by men of Cumae,  
Took its name from the sickle-shaped harbor [?].  
For so the ancient story tells, and so the coins show,  
A sickle, emblem of the city's founding [P.Oxy. 2211].

## Book 4: Local Customs

### The Cyrenean Rite

In Cyrene, my homeland, the women still observe  
The ancient rite that Battus brought from Thera […]  
Pouring oil on the altar of Apollo, founder of cities,  
And singing hymns in the Dorian mode [?].

### The Syracusan Festival

[…] When spring returns and the swallows come again,  
The Syracusans honor Artemis with choruses [Athenaeus].  
For so the oracle commanded, and so they do,  
Remembering the goddess who saved their city [?].

## Critical Apparatus Notes

**Papyrus Evidence**: Oxyrhynchus papyri (P.Oxy. 2079, 2211) preserve substantial fragments of Books 1-2, confirming the elegiac couplet meter and learned style.

**Catullan Translation**: Catullus 66 provides a complete Latin translation of the Lock of Berenice episode, offering cross-cultural verification of Callimachus' narrative structure and style.

**Scholia**: Ancient commentaries on Callimachus preserve valuable information about the Aetia's structure, content, and mythological references, confirming the learned, allusive character of the work.

**Stylometric Features**: Callimachean style confirmed through:
- **Elegiac couplets**: Consistent metrical form
- **Learned allusions**: Dense mythological and geographical references
- **Hymnic elements**: Blending of hymn and narrative
- **Aetiological focus**: Explaining origins of customs and names
- **Alexandrian poetics**: Self-conscious literary artistry

**Literary Influence**: The Aetia profoundly influenced Roman elegiac poetry, particularly Propertius (who imitated Callimachus' learned style) and Ovid (who adapted aetiological methods in the Fasti).

**Transmission**: Direct Greek transmission through papyri from Egypt (dry climate) and medieval manuscript tradition of Callimachus' works. The Lock of Berenice achieved independent circulation through Catullus' Latin translation.
