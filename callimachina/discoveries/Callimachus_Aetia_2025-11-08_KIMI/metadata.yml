    Oxyrhynchus papyri provide direct manuscript evidence. The Lock of Berenice
    (Aetia Book 4) survives through Catullus 66, providing cross-cultural
    verification. Callimachus' distinctive learned style is confirmed through
    stylometric analysis.
notes: |
  Callimachus (c. 310-240 BCE) was the most influential Hellenistic poet.
  The Aetia (Causes) was his major work, explaining customs and myths in
  elegiac couplets. Only fragments survive, but they demonstrate his learned,
  allusive style and influence on Roman poetry (Propertius, Ovid, Catullus).
