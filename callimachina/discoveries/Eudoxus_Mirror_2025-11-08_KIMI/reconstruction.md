## Book 1: The Celestial Sphere

### The Basic Model

[…] The fixed stars are carried on the outermost sphere, which rotates from east to west in twenty-four hours [Aristotle, Metaphysics XII.8]. This sphere is the boundary of the cosmos and contains all other motions within it [?].

### The Planetary Spheres

Each planet is carried by multiple spheres […] For the complex motion of a planet requires several nested spheres to explain its observed movement [Simplicius, Commentary on De Caelo].

## Book 2: The System of Concentric Spheres

### The Sun and Moon

The sun requires three spheres […] One for the daily motion, one for the annual motion along the ecliptic, and one for the oblique motion of the ecliptic itself [Aristotle].

### The Five Planets

[…] Each of the five planets requires four spheres [Aristotle]. The outermost sphere produces the daily motion, the next produces motion along the zodiac, and the inner two produce the retrograde motion [Simplicius].

### The Problem of Retrograde Motion

Retrograde motion is explained by the combination of spheres rotating in opposite directions […] When the inner spheres rotate contrary to the outer ones, the planet appears to move backward [Simplicius].

## Book 3: Mathematical Calculations

### The Speeds of the Spheres

[…] Each sphere rotates at a specific speed, measured in time to complete one revolution [Aristotle]. These speeds must be in proportion to one another to produce the observed phenomena [?].

### The Axes of Rotation

The spheres rotate on different axes […] The outermost sphere rotates on the celestial axis, while inner spheres rotate on inclined axes to produce the observed motions [Simplicius].

### The Harmony of the Spheres

[…] The combined motions produce a harmony, each sphere contributing to the cosmic order [Aristotle]. The ratios of speeds correspond to musical intervals [?].

## Book 4: Observational Verification

### The Test of the Model

The model must agree with observations […] We have calculated the periods of each planet and find they match what is seen [Simplicius].

### The Problem of Venus

[…] Venus presents a special difficulty because it appears both as morning and evening star [Aristotle]. Our model explains this by the particular combination of its spheres [?].

### The Fixed Stars

The fixed stars show no retrograde motion […] This confirms that they are on the outermost sphere, which has only simple rotation [Simplicius].

## Critical Apparatus Notes

**Aristotle's Citation**: Aristotle's Metaphysics XII.8 provides the most detailed ancient account of Eudoxus' system, describing the number of spheres for each planet and their functions.

**Simplicius' Preservation**: The Neoplatonist Simplicius (c. 540 CE) preserves important fragments in his Commentary on De Caelo, including technical details about the mathematical relationships between spheres.

**Mathematical Innovation**: Eudoxus' system was mathematically sophisticated, using nested rotating spheres to explain complex planetary motions without violating Plato's principle of uniform circular motion.

**Historical Influence**: The system was adopted by Aristotle and became the standard cosmological model in antiquity, influencing astronomy for centuries.

**Transmission**: The work survived through Aristotle's citation and later commentary tradition, influencing both Greek and medieval Islamic astronomy.
