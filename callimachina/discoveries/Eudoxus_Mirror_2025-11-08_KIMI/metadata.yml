    Eudoxus' astronomical work was highly influential. Aristotle's citation
    provides direct evidence of his planetary models. Arabic and Latin
    transmission preserved his mathematical methods. The work was foundational
    for ancient astronomy.
notes: |
  Eudoxus (c. 390-340 BCE) developed an ingenious system of concentric
  spheres to explain planetary motion. His "Mirror" described this model,
  which Aristotle adopted and expanded. The work represents a landmark in
  mathematical astronomy, combining geometric models with observational data.
