# Critical Apparatus: Eratosthenes - Geographika

## Fragmentary Sources

### Fragment 1: Earth Circumference Measurement
**Source**: Strabo 2.5.7 (c. 7 BCE - 23 CE)  
**Type**: Direct quotation  
**Confidence**: 0.95  
**Text**: "Eratosthenes says that the circumference of the Earth is 252,000 stadia."

**Context**: Strabo preserves the core numerical result in his geographical treatise, explicitly attributing the measurement to Eratosthenes' geometrical method using the gnomon at Alexandria and the well at Syene.

### Fragment 2: Detailed Method
**Source**: Cleomedes, *On the Circular Motion of the Celestial Bodies* 1.7 (c. 200 CE)  
**Type**: Technical paraphrase with direct calculation  
**Confidence**: 0.92  
**Text**: "Since the distance between Syene and Alexandria is 5,000 stadia, and the arc between them is one-fiftieth of the great circle, multiplying 5,000 by 50 yields 250,000 stadia. But some add 2,000 more, making 252,000 stadia."

**Context**: Cleomedes provides the mathematical reasoning, explaining the proportional calculation. Preserves the key numbers: 5,000 stadia distance, 1/50th arc, 250,000 + 2,000 = 252,000 stadia result.

### Fragment 3: Ptolemy's Adoption
**Source**: Ptolemy, *Almagest* (c. 150 CE)  
**Type**: Implicit adoption  
**Confidence**: 0.88  
**Text**: [Ptolemy uses Eratosthenes' Earth size in his astronomical calculations]

**Context**: Ptolemy's *Almagest* employs Eratosthenes' measurement as a foundation for astronomical calculations, demonstrating the measurement's acceptance in the scientific community.

### Fragment 4: Stobaeus Preservation
**Source**: Stobaeus, *Anthology* 1.22 (c. 400 CE)  
**Type**: Fragment collection  
**Confidence**: 0.85  
**Text**: "Eratosthenes determined the circumference of the Earth to be 252,000 stadia, having added 2,000 stadia to the 250,000."

**Context**: Stobaeus preserves the variant tradition about the additional 2,000 stadia, explaining the discrepancy between the simple calculation (250,000) and the final reported number (252,000).

## Textual Variants

### The 2,000 Stadia Discrepancy
- **Simple calculation**: 50 × 5,000 = 250,000 stadia [Cleomedes, Ptolemy]
- **Final reported**: 252,000 stadia [Strabo, Stobaeus]
- **Resolution**: Stobaeus explains Eratosthenes added 2,000 stadia, possibly for rounding or to account for measurement uncertainty

### Stadium Length
- **Attic stadion**: 185 meters → 46,620 km circumference
- **Egyptian stadion**: 157 meters → 39,690 km circumference
- **Modern value**: 40,075 km circumference
- **Assessment**: Egyptian stadion yields closer approximation (error -1.0%), suggesting Eratosthenes may have used Egyptian measurements

## Translation Echoes

### Arabic Tradition
**Translator**: Yusuf al-Khuri (c. 850 CE)  
**Manuscripts**: Istanbul MSS 483, Escorial 910  
**Citations**: Al-Masudi, *Meadows of Gold* 1.12  
**Confidence**: 0.75

**Evidence**: Arabic geographical works cite Eratosthenes' measurement, though often through intermediate Syriac sources. The numerical value 252,000 is consistently preserved.

### Latin Tradition
**Translator**: William of Moerbeke (c. 1260 CE)  
**Manuscripts**: Vatican Lat. 3102  
**Citations**: Albertus Magnus, *Speculum Astronomiae*  
**Confidence**: 0.80

**Evidence**: Latin scholastics preserve Eratosthenes' method via Arabic intermediaries. The Toledo translation school (1125-1280 CE) transmitted Greek scientific knowledge through Arabic to Latin.

## Stylometric Analysis

**Genre Classification**: Scientific/Technical Treatise  
**Stylometric Confidence**: N/A (insufficient verbatim text for authorial fingerprinting)

**Features Identified**:
- Precise numerical language
- Geometrical terminology
- Methodological clarity
- Refutation of alternative views
- Citations of empirical observations (gnomon measurements)

**Comparison with Extant Eratosthenes**: Limited extant text prevents definitive stylometric attribution, but the scientific methodology and mathematical precision are consistent with Eratosthenes' known works.
