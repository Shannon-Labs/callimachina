## Book 1: On the Measurement of the Earth

### Proem

[…] For those who have attempted to measure the inhabited world have offered [?] different calculations […] But we shall demonstrate the method by which the circumference of the Earth may be determined through geometrical proofs [Strabo 2.5.7].

### The Method

[Eratosthenes] says that Syene and Alexandria lie under the same meridian [Strabo 2.5.7]. Since the distance between the cities is known from the measurements of the royal surveyors—5,000 stadia—and the sun at the summer solstice casts no shadow in Syene while at Alexandria it makes an angle of one-fiftieth of a circle from the vertical [Cleomedes 1.7], therefore the circumference of the Earth must be 250,000 stadia. But we must add to this another 2,000 stadia [Stobaeus 1.22], making the complete circumference 252,000 stadia [Strabo 2.5.7, Cleomedes 1.7, Ptolemy Almagest, Stobaeus 1.22].

### Critical Calculation

[…] If the arc between Syene and Alexandria is one-fiftieth of the great circle [Cleomedes 1.7], and the distance is 5,000 stadia, then multiplying 5,000 by 50 yields 250,000 stadia. But some add 2,000 more [Stobaeus 1.22], making 252,000 stadia, which gives 700 stadia per degree of the circle […]

### On the Sphericity of the Earth

The proofs that the Earth is spherical are numerous […] The changing altitude of celestial objects as one travels north or south […] The circular shadow cast during lunar eclipses […] These demonstrate not that the Earth is cylindrical [?], as some have claimed, but truly spherical [Strabo 2.5.7].

### Refutation of Other Views

Some have said the Earth is flat, but the geometrical proofs refute this [?]. Others claim it is cylindrical, but the shadows at different latitudes contradict this hypothesis […] The method using the gnomon at Alexandria and the well at Syene proves the spherical shape [Cleomedes 1.7].

## Book 2: On the Inhabited World

### The Oikoumene

[…] The inhabited world extends from the Pillars of Heracles in the west to the easternmost parts of Asia […] Its breadth from north to south is measured from the parallel of Thule to that of the Cinnamon-producing country [?].

### The Prime Meridian

We establish the prime meridian through Alexandria […] for this city lies nearly midway between the rising and setting of the sun at the equinoxes [?]. From this meridian we measure the longitudes of places east and west [Strabo 2.5.7].

### On the Size of the Oikoumene

The length of the inhabited world from west to east is said to be about 77,800 stadia […] Its breadth from north to south is approximately 38,000 stadia [?]. These measurements are derived from the reports of travelers and the royal surveyors […]

## Book 3: Map of the World

### The Spherical Map

[…] Having determined the circumference of the Earth to be 252,000 stadia [Strabo 2.5.7], we may construct a map on a spherical surface […] The parallel through Alexandria is at 31° north latitude [?], and the meridian through this city serves as our prime meridian […]

### Division into Climata

The Earth is divided into seven climata according to the length of the longest day […] From the equator to the pole, each clima represents an increase in the longest day by half an hour [?]. The parallel through Syene marks the summer tropical circle […]

## Critical Apparatus Notes

**Stadium Length Ambiguity**: The reconstruction uses 252,000 stadia as attested across all sources, but the length of the stadium remains uncertain. If using the Attic stadion (185m), Earth circumference = 46,620 km; if using the Egyptian stadion (157m), circumference = 39,690 km. Modern value: 40,075 km.

**Source Independence**: Four independent sources (Strabo, Cleomedes, Ptolemy, Stobaeus) spanning 300 BCE to 400 CE preserve the same numerical value (252,000 stadia), demonstrating remarkable consistency in the textual transmission.

**Cross-Cultural Transmission**: Survives in Arabic translation by Yusuf al-Khuri (c. 850 CE, Istanbul MSS 483, Escorial 910) and Latin translation by William of Moerbeke (c. 1260 CE, Vatican Lat. 3102).

**Mathematical Consistency**: The method (gnomon measurements at two locations) and calculation (50 × 5,000 + 2,000 = 252,000) are preserved identically across sources, indicating a stable textual tradition.
