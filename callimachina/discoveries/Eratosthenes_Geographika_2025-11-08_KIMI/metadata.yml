    Base confidence 63.0% enhanced through Bayesian updating.
    Six independent evidence factors:
    1. Bayesian prior (genre/period): 0.72 (geography genre high survival,
       Hellenistic period good attestation)
    2. Citation quality: 0.64 (4 independent sources, direct quotes weighted 1.0x)
    3. Temporal weight: 0.84 (sources span 300 BCE - 400 CE, +0.15/century spread)
    4. Cross-cultural bonus: 0.25 (Arabic +0.15, Latin +0.10, multiple paths +0.05)
    5. Network centrality: 0.13 (degree 4, key transmitter status)
    6. Stylometric: 0.00 (not applicable for scientific text)
    
    Log-odds transformation yields posterior mean 99.6% with tight credible interval.
    Earth circumference measurement (252,000 stadia) attested across all sources
    with consistent numerical value.
notes: |
  Critical apparatus notes stadium length ambiguity (Attic 185m vs Egyptian 157m)
  affects Earth size calculation range: 39,690-46,620 km. Modern value: 40,075 km.
  Eratosthenes' method demonstrates sophisticated understanding of spherical
  geometry and simultaneous astronomical observations at Syene and Alexandria.
