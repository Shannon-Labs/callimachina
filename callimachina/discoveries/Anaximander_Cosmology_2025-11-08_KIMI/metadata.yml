    particularly Theophrastus' Physical Opinions and later commentators.
    The work's revolutionary cosmological ideas (infinite apeiron, celestial
    mechanics, biological evolution) generated extensive ancient discussion.
    Multiple sources preserve the distinctive arguments for his cosmic system.
notes: |
  Anaximander's Cosmology was the first systematic philosophical treatise on
  the origin and structure of the universe, introducing the concept of the
  apeiron (infinite or boundless) as the fundamental principle. The work
  presented revolutionary ideas about celestial mechanics, the position of
  Earth in space, and the natural origin of life. Its influence on subsequent
  Presocratic philosophy was foundational, ensuring preservation through
  doxographical tradition and ancient philosophical commentary.
