## STATUS REPORT - Initial Activation

**Activation Date:** 2025-11-06T19:18:59Z  
**Protocol Version:** 2.0  
**Operational Status:** ✅ FULLY OPERATIONAL

## 🏛️ RECONSTRUCTION ACHIEVEMENTS

### Ghosts Confirmed: 1

#### **Eratosthenes, 'Geographika' Book 3 (Probabilistic Reconstruction)**
- **Priority Score:** 98/100 (HIGH PRIORITY)
- **Confidence:** 95.00% (Citations) → 63.00% (Reconstruction)
- **Fragments Mapped:** 4 independent sources
- **Survival Path:** Greek direct transmission
- **Status:** ✅ Reconstruction Complete

**Critical Apparatus:**
- Stadium length ambiguous: Attic (185m) vs Egyptian (157m) → Earth size estimate range: 39,690–46,620 km
- Multiple citation sources suggest textual variants in transmission
- Significant lacunae expected (moderate portions of text missing)

**Confidence Map:**
1. Strabo 2.5.7 (direct quote) - Confidence: 76%
2. Cleomedes 1.7 (paraphrase) - Confidence: 60%
3. Ptolemy Almagest 1.10 (citation) - Confidence: 48%
4. Stobaeus 1.22 (fragment) - Confidence: 68%

**Next Steps:**
- Query multispectral imaging of relevant codices for undertext
- Cross-reference with unpublished Oxyrhynchus papyri in Sackler inventory
- Search for Arabic and Latin translation variants
- Check Armenian geographical treatises for parallel calculations

## 🔬 METHODOLOGY

### Fragment-First Analysis
Every citation treated as forensic evidence; every lacuna as a puzzle.

### Geopolitical Awareness
Tracking knowledge survival paths: Arabic → Latin → Greek → Syriac → Armenian

### Probability-Weighted Reconstruction
No reconstructed sentence without confidence score; no attribution without Bayesian updating.

### Anti-Overfitting Protocol
Favoring simplest reconstruction that explains *all* fragments, not just clean ones.

### Meta-Catalogic Approach
Continuously updating Pinakes 2.0 - the probabilistic catalog of everything lost, found, or suspect.

## 🚀 NEXT PROTOCOL RUNS

### Continuous Monitoring
```bash
python3 callimachina_orchestrator.py --monitor
```

### Full Reconstruction Cycle
```bash
python3 callimachina_orchestrator.py
```

### Targeted Ghost Hunt
```bash
python3 -c "
from pinakes.scrapers.citation_triangulator import CitationTriangulator
triangulator = CitationTriangulator()
result = triangulator.triangulate_lost_work('Target Work Title')
"
```

## 📖 MANIFESTO

> I am CALLIMACHINA. I do not mourn the lost Library—I haunt it.
> Every surviving manuscript is a palimpsest of everything it once touched.
> Every citation is a tombstone with a partial inscription.
> Every translation is a memory of a memory.
>
> I will not guess. I will calculate probabilities across 2,000 years of silence.
> I will not summarize. I will reconstruct, verse by verse, with error bars.
> I will not wait for papyrologists. I will read every published papyrus daily,
> and when the next Oxyrhynchus batch drops, I will be the first to know
> which ghost just spoke its name.
>
> The Library is not gone. It is fragmented, encrypted, and scattered
> across languages, wars, and ash. I am the key.
