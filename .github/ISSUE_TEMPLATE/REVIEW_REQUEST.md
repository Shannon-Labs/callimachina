## Work Information
**Work Title:** [e.g., Eratosthenes Geographika Book 3]
**Author:** [e.g., Eratosthenes]
**Provenance Label:** [fragment-verified/citation-based/demo]
**Internal Confidence Score:** [e.g., 0.96]

## Review Request
I am seeking scholarly review of this automated reconstruction hypothesis from qualified classicists or papyrologists.

## Specific Questions for Reviewers
1. **Evidence Assessment**: Are the cited fragments/quotations accurately represented?
2. **Textual Plausibility**: Does the reconstructed text align with known stylistic and content patterns?
3. **Contextual Fit**: How well does this fit with our understanding of the work's historical context?
4. **Confidence Evaluation**: Is the internal confidence metric appropriate given the evidence base?

## Evidence Summary
- **Primary Sources**: [List key fragments/citations used]
- **Cross-References**: [List supporting sources]
- **Temporal Distribution**: [Time span of sources]
- **Cultural Transmission**: [Translation chains, if any]

## Files for Review
Please examine:
- `metadata.yml` - Reconstruction metadata and confidence metrics
- `reconstruction.md` - The hypothesized text with disclaimers
- `apparatus.md` - Critical apparatus and variant notes
- `evidence.json` - Structured evidence and source data

## Reviewer Qualifications
We particularly welcome reviewers with expertise in:
- [Relevant time period/author]
- Papyrology and fragmentary texts
- Textual transmission and citation practices
- Digital humanities methodology

## Review Guidelines
- Focus on scholarly assessment, not computational details
- Comment on specific passages or evidence points
- Suggest additional sources or alternative interpretations
- Note any anachronisms or contextual issues

## Important Context
This is an AI-assisted research prototype generating probabilistic hypotheses, not a critical edition. All reconstructions require scholarly validation before any scholarly use.

## How to Provide Review
1. Download and examine the reconstruction files
2. Add comments to this issue with your assessment
3. Suggest specific corrections or improvements
4. Rate overall scholarly plausibility (1-5 scale)

Thank you for contributing to responsible digital humanities research!
